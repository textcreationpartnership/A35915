         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>O my dear <hi>State Rogue!</hi> why 'ſaith I'm juſt now going to your Houſe at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> that Famous Nurſery of your Name and Family.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>J. U.</speaker>
               <p>Why, to tell you the Truth, I'm going to try what I can do in order to ſtem that Tide of Blood that runs with ſuch a mighty Torrent from the Veins of my diſtreſſed dear Country-men.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>What ſome Project of Peace on foot, <hi>Jack?</hi> 'Tis ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on my Life, and the Grand <hi>Lewis</hi> has made thee Mediator. Well, thou'rt a rare Fellow; a moſt excellent Undertaker. I ſee thou haſt not thy Name for nothing, no more than I.</p>

               <p>Why look you, I intend to propoſe it to the Houſe, the carrying on a vigorous War againſt <hi>France,</hi> or carrying on the War againſt <hi>France</hi> with vigour; take it which way you will.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. R.</speaker>
               <p>A very pretty Propoſal. Why this has been propoſed, and reſolved on, Seven years agon.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. U.</speaker>
               <p>Why ay this is true; but you ſee, and we all ſee, that here is nothing come of it. Therefore I intend to undertake the Buſineſs my ſelf, my dear <hi>State Rogue:</hi> And firſt, I'll know of our wiſe Senate how many Millions <hi>per An.</hi> they will give me to do it; and how many Years they are willing to allow me to humble this great and mighty Monarch of <hi>France.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>J. U.</speaker>
               <p>Why then, for Six Millions <hi>per An.</hi> and Seven Years to effect it, I'll undertake the Buſineſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. R.</speaker>
               <p>What alone, and without an Army?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. U.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, ay, alone; and without an Army. Give me but Money enough, and let me alone for Undertaking?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. R.</speaker>
               <p>As how prethee?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>J. U.</speaker>
               <p>Why, thus, do you mark me? Look you, as ſoon as I have got the Money, away go I into <hi>Flanders,</hi> live great, ſpend the Money, no matter how; look on peaceably, and be a Witneſs of the King of <hi>France</hi>'s taking ſeveral of our ſtrong Towns; and when the <hi>French</hi> Army have done the Buſineſs, they cut out for that Campaign, and are gon to their Winter Quarters, away come I home again; tell the Parliament what noble Feats I have done, ask them for another Six Millions, return to <hi>Flanders</hi> again the next Seaſon, and do juſt as I did, before; and ſo go on till the Seven years are expired: And if this won't reduce <hi>France,</hi> and ſave the Lives and Reputation of our brave <hi>Engliſh</hi> Boys, the Devil is in't.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. R.</speaker>
               <p>Ha, ha, ha, by my troth thou makeſt me laugh; a moſt incomparable Project! O rare Mr. <hi>Undertaker!</hi> But thou'rt not in earneſt ſure <hi>Jack?</hi>

               <p>Not in earneſt? Yes, in good gerning earneſt. Why pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thee <hi>State Rogue</hi> where is the Difficulty? Is there any Difficulty in my going into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and back again? Is there any Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in my ſtanding by, whilſt the <hi>French</hi> take our Towns? Is

Where, in the Name of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> than lies the Difficulty of carrying on my Project? Now, Mr. <hi>State Rogue,</hi> what occaſion have you for laughing?</p>

               <p>Ha, ha, ha; Oh I ſhall die, I ſhall die; ha, ha, ha; Oh I ſhall kill my ſelf with laughing. Why the Devil's in thee ſure to talk at this rate.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. U.</speaker>
               <p>Now can't I, for the Soul of me, underſtand where lies this merry Conceit; nor what in the Name of Fate it is that thou laugheſt at. I ask thee where's the Difficulty in my Undertaking, and thou falleſt a Laughing.</p>

               <p>Ha, ha, ha; why no, my noble <hi>Undertaker,</hi> here's no great Difficulty in thy going into <hi>Flanders,</hi> and back again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the Difficulty remains Man ſtill of conquering <hi>France.</hi> And the Difficulty is, That the Parliament ſhould be ſuch a Pack of Fools, and Aſſes, as to give thee ſuch a Maſs of Treaſure as thou haſt projected, to the impoveriſhing and ſinking the Nation, to carry on a Project that has neither Head nor Tail; to carry on a vigorous War with <hi>France,</hi> and here's no War commenced, nor like to be, according to thy Project.</p>

               <speaker>J. U.</speaker>
               <p>Shaw, ſhaw, you talk like an Apothecary. Why is it not the ſame Thing for the Parliament to give me the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions for looking on, and ſeeing our Towns taken, as to give it to a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man, who takes with him a mighty Army, and does no more with it than I do alone? Nay, don't I deſerve it infinitely better? For do I hazard any one but my ſelf, and that not much you ſee? Do I harraſs a Hundred thouſand Men off their Legs, one Year after another, to as little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as to ſet our Dogs to bark againſt the Moon? Do I let Men die like Dogs in Ditches, and ſtarve them for want of Bread? Do I lead on an Army to Face the Enemy, cry holoo, ſet them on, and then run away, and leave them to be ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced? Where's the Wonderment then in giving me theſe mighty Sums, who am an honeſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, for doing alone better Service than the <hi>Dutch</hi> Man, and all his Army? Why don't I maintain the Honour and Reputation of our Country, and Coun<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ry-men, infinitely better than he? For I'm reſolved
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:53180:3"/>never to put it to the hazard of a Battle, or being ſhamefully beaten, when I know we muſt be beaten ſo often as we fight. What think you, Mr. <hi>State Rogue,</hi> I think the Caſe is plain and clear: And yet if the Parliament gives me theſe formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable Sums preſently, they are a Pack of Fools, and Aſſes. But to give it to this <hi>Dutch</hi> Man, who has no more Right or Title to it than I have, they are a wiſe Senate. Prethee ſhew me the Wiſdom for the one, and the Folly for the other, and now you had beſt laugh again.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. R.</speaker>
               <p>By my Life I begin to think thou'rt in earneſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. U.</speaker>
               <p>Why have I not Reaſon to be ſo? I don't ſee but the Project may take. I have as much Money as he 'tis true, but ſtill I ſave the Men. And if the Parliament is ſo prodigal of their Countries Money, as to throw it away to no purpoſe, may it not as well, nay better, be given to an honeſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man, as well as to a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man? Beſides, I could find ways to ſpend the Money at home, and ſo let it ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>culate, and not impoveriſh the Nation. And is not this better than the <hi>Dutch</hi> Man's ſending it abroad to be circumciſed, and ſo ſent home to us again to ſet us all together by th' Ears?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. R.</speaker>
               <p>Come <hi>Jack,</hi> prethee leave off this Boffoonery, and be ſerious. What, in the Name of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſhould make thee imagine that the Parliament ſhould give thee ſuch vaſt Sums of Money for no Service; only for looking on, and ſeeing the <hi>French</hi> conquer, and take our Towns?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. U.</speaker>
               <p>And what, in the Name of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> ſhould make thee approve of their actually giving it to a <hi>Dutch</hi> Man, for the very ſame Non-ſervice?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>S. R.</speaker>
               <p>Prethee has not this <hi>Dutch</hi> Man (as thou calleſt him) a formidable Army at his Command, to oppoſe the Growth and Greatneſs of the Power of <hi>France,</hi> to hinder them from making any further Progreſs in their Conqueſts, and to carry on the War with vigour againſt them?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>J. U.</speaker>
               <p>Very good; and after Six years Experience, and trial of Skill, what has this <hi>Dutch</hi> Man, and his mighty Army, done more than I alone would have done? Have not the <hi>French,</hi> for all him and his formidable Army, been always
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:53180:3"/>ſucceſsful? Have they not taken what Towns they pleaſed? Have they not ſhamefully beaten us, time after time, ſo often as they had a mind to fight us?

Be ſure you lay before your Brother Rogues a Maſs of Money, a Million at leaſt of the Three ſhall be diſtributed amongſt them, as a yearly Pention, to encourage them in their Roguery, and make them a Pack of thorough paced Villians; for thoſe you know are the Men of Honour, the Men of Worſhip, in little <hi>England.</hi>

There is not ſuch a Devil in Hell as this Money, to work a Parliament-man into what Form or Figure you pleaſe; enough of this will make him what Devil you have a mind to, and when he has got the Money, call him as many Rogues, Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains, and Devils as you pleaſe, he laughs at ye; and crys, 'tis
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:53180:5"/>better to be a rich Rogue than a poor Devil, as ye <hi>Jacobnes</hi> are, ſtarving about Town under that fooliſh Notion of Loyalty. Five thouſand Guineas didſt thou ſay, for a Bribe? Ay, that may do, I'll take it: And if I give it back again, as my Lord what do you call him did, mark me down for a Fool, as well as a Knave. Prethee tell me, <hi>Jack,</hi> is not every Man deſirous to put himſelf into the Mode, and Faſhion of the Times? Why now is the Time, and Faſhion, for every Man to be a Knave, a Villain, a Rogue, a Rebel, a Traytor; and he who is the greateſt, is the moſt admired; and in this we glory and pride our ſelves, and laugh and deſpiſe ſuch poor honeſt Loyaliſts as thou, and thy Suffering Brethren term your ſelves; who have little elſe to do, but to ſigh, and groan, for a turn of Fate, which ye call by the Name of better Times. Alas poor Animals! We often meet you in the Streets with dejected Countenances, like ſo many Ghoſts that live in Monuments, and have no other Converſation than amongſt the Dead: And your only Diverſion is, to curſe the Times, rail ſtrenuouſly againſt the Government, to get into little <hi>Jacobite</hi> Coffee-houſes, and Ale houſe Clubs, (for the poor Devils have no Money to drink Wine with) there to build Caſtles in the Air, how King <hi>James</hi> is to be reſtor'd, and then what brave ſwaggering Boys you'll be.
